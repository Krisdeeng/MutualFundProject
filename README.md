# **Mutual Fund Performance Analysis**
## Welcome to the WorkSample folder of Kris Tran (Nhan Tran). 

## Introduction:
Kris' own development of SAS, SQL and Macros programming in the research of Canadian mutual fund performance (1000+ funds, 1991-2016).

### Declaration of purpose:
I would like to use this folder to present a part of the coding work I have been doing in my statistical analysis research work from 2016-2019.

1. Note 1: 100% of the codes are hand-written by myself without any help.

2. Note 2: Some of the codes may be from the older versions. Any seemingly missing/limited access parts are intentional due to integrity and confidentiality reasons.

3. Note 3: The codes represent a small part of the very lengthened research process, from one among many researches that I have conducted and participated in.


## It has been a pleasure!
Thank you very much for visiting.
If you have any questions or request of my collaboration, please feel free to contact me via the email nhansec@gmail.com.
